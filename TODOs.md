  - [] full coverage
  - [] commit hooks
  - [] GitHub hooks
  - [] tests that depend on other's status (plugin)
  - [] test dataclasses (if it will be somehow fixed)
- [] dataclasses - check whether anything can be done in order to make singletons work with
  dataclasses (if there will be typing for dataclassy behaviour, maybe wrap
  the normal dataclass decorator with a custom one and make it dataclass_decorator)
